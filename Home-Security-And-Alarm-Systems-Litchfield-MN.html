Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires.

Expect to see more sirens, both indoor and out, over the coming year as the wise brands expand their ranges. If you receive a billing for extreme incorrect alarms, you might appeal it. Initially, we recommend that you telephone the Napa Police Department Records Division to discuss your concerns and issues. If you are unhappy with the results of this conversation, you might ask for an official appeal hearing.</p>
