<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
