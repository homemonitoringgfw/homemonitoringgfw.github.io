<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
