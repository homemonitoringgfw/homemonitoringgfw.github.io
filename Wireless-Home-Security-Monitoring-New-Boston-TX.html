<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
