<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to overlook objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
