<p>The best in wise home security systems. Surveillance camera systems enable you to prevent theft and reduce shrinkage. Ninety percent of theft is internal; see what goes on that you wouldn't otherwise know about. Make sure that your operational and safety treatments are being followed and examine any mishaps that take place. Afford yourself the assurance and practical benefits of safeguarding your possessions and employees.</p>
<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment prices is incredibly affordable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

That's still significant, however it's a lot less than the average loss of a break-in. While the rate of thefts nationally has decreased, the typical loss has increased-- in 2018, that number was close to $3,0002 (more on that in the break-in data area above).</p>
