<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
