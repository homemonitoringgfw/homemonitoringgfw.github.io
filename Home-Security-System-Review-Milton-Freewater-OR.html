<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
