<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
