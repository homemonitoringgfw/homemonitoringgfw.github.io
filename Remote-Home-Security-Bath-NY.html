<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
