This camera offers a wide variety of functions including a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I examined a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the road.

<p>When your video cameras are set up, you can select whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you select to have your cameras monitored (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is triggered. Nevertheless, you may pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the customer. </p>
