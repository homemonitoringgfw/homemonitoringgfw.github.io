<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
