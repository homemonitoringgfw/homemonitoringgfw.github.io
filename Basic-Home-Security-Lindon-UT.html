<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store.
