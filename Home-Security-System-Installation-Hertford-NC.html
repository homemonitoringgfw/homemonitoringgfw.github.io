<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
