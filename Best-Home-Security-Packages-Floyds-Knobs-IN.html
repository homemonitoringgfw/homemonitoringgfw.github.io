<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly changing the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so crucial?  For beginners, Deep Knowing allows someone to discover what they are searching for without needing to search through hours of worthless video footage.  Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are looking for in the taped video footage.

Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
