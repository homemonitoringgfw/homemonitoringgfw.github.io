<h3>Monitored Home Alarm in Monmouth IL</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control board (normally situated in the entrance hall) that is used to disarm the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have been activated, smart alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have been set off, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours).

When something crucial occurs, you are proactively made aware through push notifications to your phone and portal.</p>
