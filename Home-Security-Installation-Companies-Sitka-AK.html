<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
