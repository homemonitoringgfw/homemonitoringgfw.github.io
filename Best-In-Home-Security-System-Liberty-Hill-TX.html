<p>Customer support is Frontpoint's strength. While the company does not use rather as numerous hours of consumer support as other brands, it has a fantastic track record with lots of vocal, pleased consumers.

<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices.

The same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much picture details as 1080p.

<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so crucial?  For starters, Deep Learning allows somebody to find what they are searching for without needing to search through hours of ineffective video footage.  Think of a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the elements you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have a powerful option for capturing bad guys and collecting proof.</p>
<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you acquire a monitored security strategy, the exact same company that monitors the system will install it for you.
