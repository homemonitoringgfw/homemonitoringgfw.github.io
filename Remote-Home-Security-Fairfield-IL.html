<p>Siren A number of one-box systems like Canary and Somfy feature a very loud integrated siren that should hopefully frighten intruders (or next door's feline). Expect to see more sirens, both indoor and out, over the coming year as the wise brand names expand their varieties. You might appeal it if you get a billing for excessive incorrect alarms.

<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is essential.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to distinguish between a car and an individual, for example, allows you to minimize unneeded informs. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, an entrance, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
