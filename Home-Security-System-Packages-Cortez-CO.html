Likewise, the app stays tough to navigate, though they are moving users to a newer app called 'SmartThings Connect' which has potential.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off).
