<p>One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be an economical option for clients in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available.
