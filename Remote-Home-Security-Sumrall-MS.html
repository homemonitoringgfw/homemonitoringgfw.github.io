Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens may breach local sound control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
