<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
