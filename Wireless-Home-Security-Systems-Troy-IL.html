<p>One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which could be an inexpensive alternative for clients in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
