<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
