We likewise discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
