The city has actually given that adopted a new collaboration with General Electric in which street lights are geared up with microphones and cameras.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in multiple areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smart device (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
