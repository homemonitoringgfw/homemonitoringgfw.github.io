We likewise found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
