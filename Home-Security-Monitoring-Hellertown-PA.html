<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically much safer, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply would not connect. An assistance window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep assisted her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could tell there was an issue with the circuit board. Definitely not ideal-- however the representative said sorry and delivered her replacement control board over night.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by an area feline, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

<p>Recording the footage from your security cameras requires disk drives or cloud based storage.

<p>It depends on the size and design of the home and the monitoring objectives. The advantages of cameras are that you can get visual verification of any activity happening inside or outside the home.

<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to as much as 20 family members. However, shared monitoring isn't a function offered from all companies. Be sure to look into the company's features or speak with a representative straight if this is a high priority. Responding to incorrect alarms can needlessly cost Sumner - and its taxpayers - money each year. In addition, officers reacting to these false alarms are not able to respond to real emergency situations or carry out preventative patrols.</p>
