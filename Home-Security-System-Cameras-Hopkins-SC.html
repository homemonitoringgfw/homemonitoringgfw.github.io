<h2>How To Choose A CCTV System in Hopkins</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of a number of cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor.

You get an alert in your smartphone app if your motion sensor is triggered. There's no latency so you get notified right away so you can take instant actions such as setting off a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to speak to the prospective trespassers.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
