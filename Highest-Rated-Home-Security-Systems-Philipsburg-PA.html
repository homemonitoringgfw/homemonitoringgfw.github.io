Typically you would discover a PCB with lots of terminals or antennas for connections. Numerous likewise have built-in backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port. Some might have a serial port for connection to a professional's computer system for diagnostics. These are the true heart of the system. A lot of control (user interface) panels link directly to this panel in older or larger wired systems. In many cases, the interface does link directly to the parts or service, but most of the times it is relayed through a center or main panel.</p>
